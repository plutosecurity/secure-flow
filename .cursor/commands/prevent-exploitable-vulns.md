# Prevent Exploitable Vulnerabilities

## Overview

Set up CI/CD checks to block the inclusion of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) to your codebase. Update this project's CI/CD to scan for vulnerabilities that are listed in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog using Trivy filesystem scanning. If any of these vulnerabilities are found, the CI/CD should fail and block the commit.

## Steps

1. **Workflow Setup**
    - Check if there is another Trivy workflow in the repository
    - If workflow exists, add the new step to the existing workflow
    - If no workflow exists, create a new workflow file
    - Name the step "Opspace - KEV gating"
    - Ensure the workflow runs on the branch where the PR is created so users can see results before merging

2. **Trivy Filesystem Scan**
    - Use only Trivy filesystem scanning via the aquasecurity/trivy-action GitHub Action
    - Do not integrate with other security tools
    - Configure Trivy to scan the filesystem for vulnerabilities
    - Ensure output is in JSON format and saved for the next steps

3. **CISA KEV Catalog Download**
    - Create a step that downloads the CISA KEV catalog in JSON format
    - Use URL: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json

4. **Vulnerability Matching**
    - Parse the Trivy JSON output to extract CVE IDs
    - Match CVE IDs from Trivy output with the CISA KEV catalog
    - Use CVE ID from Trivy output to match it with the CISA KEV catalog
    - If CVE ID is found in the catalog, the CI/CD should fail and block the commit

5. **Logging and Reporting**
    - Add detailed logs showing the number of vulnerabilities found
    - Display vulnerability details including:
        - CVE ID
        - CISA Details (Vendor, Product, Vulnerability Name, Due Date, Required Action)
        - Affected Packages (Package Name, Current Version, Fixed Version, Severity, Description)
    - Show user confidence that the workflow is working

6. **Workflow Logic**
    - If there are no vulnerabilities found, the workflow should pass
    - If vulnerabilities are found in CISA KEV catalog, fail the workflow
    - IMPORTANT: Do not create separate code files - all logic should be written in shell script inside the GitHub Actions workflow file

7. **Initial Testing**
    - For initial commit, either create a requirements.txt or change it by adding pillow==8.2.0 to ensure the pipeline fails and works (it has a CISA vulnerability)
    - Once verified working, remove this test line

## Example Script

Here is an example of a working script that can achieve this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

TARGET="${1:-./}"
TRIVY_OUTPUT="/tmp/trivy-results.json"
CISA_KEV_URL="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json"
CISA_KEV_FILE="/tmp/cisa-kev.json"

echo "Running Trivy scan on target: $TARGET"
trivy fs --format json --output "$TRIVY_OUTPUT" "$TARGET"

echo "Fetching CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog..."
curl -s "$CISA_KEV_URL" -o "$CISA_KEV_FILE"

echo "Checking for exploited vulnerabilities..."

exploited_found=false
exploited_packages=()

trivy_cves=$(jq -r '.Results[]?.Vulnerabilities[]?.VulnerabilityID // empty' "$TRIVY_OUTPUT" 2>/dev/null | sort -u)

if [ -z "$trivy_cves" ]; then
    echo "No vulnerabilities found by Trivy"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Found $(echo "$trivy_cves" | wc -l) unique CVEs in Trivy results"
echo ""

for cve in $trivy_cves; do
    kev_details=$(jq --arg cve "$cve" '.vulnerabilities[] | select(.cveID == $cve)' "$CISA_KEV_FILE" 2>/dev/null)

    if [ -n "$kev_details" ]; then
        echo "🚨 EXPLOITED VULNERABILITY FOUND: $cve"
        echo "   CISA Details:"
        echo "   - Vendor: $(echo "$kev_details" | jq -r '.vendorProject // "N/A"')"

        echo ""

        # Get package details from Trivy results
        package_details=$(jq --arg cve "$cve" '

                )

        fi

        echo "----------------------------------------"

```

## Important Notes

- You need to use CVE ID from Trivy output to match it with the CISA KEV catalog. If the CVE ID is found in the catalog, the CI/CD should fail and block the commit.
- IMPORTANT & CRITICAL: Ensure to have this workflow also run on the branch where the PR is created so that user can see the results before merging.
