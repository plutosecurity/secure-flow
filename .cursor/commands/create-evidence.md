# Create Evidence

## Overview

Help generate compliance evidence artifacts for specified security controls. Create audit-ready documentation proving controls are implemented and effective.

## Steps

1. **Compliance Framework Mapping**
    - Identify relevant frameworks: SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP
    - Map controls to applicable requirements
2. **Evidence Artifact Generation**
    - Generate configuration evidence (web server configs, IAM policies, encryption settings, logging configs)
    - Create code evidence (file paths, line numbers, code snippets showing implementation)
    - Collect log evidence (authentication logs, HTTPS logs, access control logs, security event logs)
    - Gather test results (penetration tests, vulnerability scans, security assessments)
3. **Documentation Format**
    - Provide structured data (JSON/CSV summaries with control ID, name, evidence type, location, timestamp, status)
    - Create human-readable summaries (control overview, implementation details, evidence summary, status)
    - Include code references (file paths, line numbers, code snippets with context)
4. **Compliance Mapping**
    - Map evidence to specific compliance requirements (SOC 2 CC6.1, ISO 27001 A.9.1.1, NIST CSF PR.AC-1, GDPR Article 32)
    - Include timestamp, version information, and verification steps
    - Generate actual, usable evidence files in multiple formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, human-readable)
    - Ensure all evidence is timestamped, versioned, and includes proper context
